      For the last few years, I’ve kept a sort of low-profile-down-the-page section of my personal site where I collect and refine principles—ideas that have helped me lead, design, and stay grounded. It started as a place to process hard-earned lessons. Over time, it became something I could actually lean on.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      These principles weren’t handed to me in a workshop. I earned them in the chaos—through late nights, last-minute launches, and pulling things back from the edge. They showed up when things were fragile—when a teammate was drowning and I quietly stepped in. When someone needed space, and the work didn’t come first. That’s when they stopped being ideas and started becoming practice.
    </p>
    
    <div class="prose prose-slate">
      <p><strong class="mb-1">“Lead at every level”</strong> isn’t about grabbing the wheel. It’s about knowing when to step back so someone else can steer.</p>
      <p><strong class="mb-1">“No heroes”</strong> means the system matters more than any one person—but we protect people by building systems that don’t burn them out.</p>
      <p><strong class="mb-0">“Extraordinary is consistently ordinary”</strong> is how I work, how I parent, how I show up. Even on the tough days.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      I’m drawn to work that matters—but even more than that, to teams that stay human when things get messy. That’s where principles stop being slogans and start becoming tools.</p>
      
    <p class="font-bold">
      That’s the kind of work I want to be part of.</p>
