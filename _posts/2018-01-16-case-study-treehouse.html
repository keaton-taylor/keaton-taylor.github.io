    <h3 class="text-2xl mb-2 font-bold">My Role</h3>
    <p class="pb-6">During my time at Treehouse, I was lucky enough to work on the Techdegree (TD) squad. Our squad was
      a cross-functional team focused on acquisition and conversion. I worked with my PM and engineering partners to
      define and frame in-scope problems. My role within the team was as a co-facilitator and design lead. In this
      project we were able to increase the number of students attending weekly office hours, win back previous
      Techdegree students, and ship some really helpful quality of life features to our students!</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl mb-2 font-bold">The Problem Space</h3>
    <p class="pb-6">The Techdegree was a relatively new product. Data for our programs were pointing to a need to
      optimize the existing experience. Through exit interviews that teachers carried out, we learned that students felt
      that support needs were not met. Teachers and success representatives felt like students weren't taking advantage
      of existing resources. For example, weekly office hours were being held for each of the offered disciplines but
      attendance hovered around 10-20%.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl mb-2 font-bold">Challenges & Constraints</h3>
    <p class="pb-6">Building features that are useful across the user-base (from trial to paid) is a first-tier goal at
      Treehouse. With this project the challenge really centered around how to make something as banal as using Slack
      feel human and personal. In an educational situation, it's even more pressing. A student has to complete specific
      units and assignments in a timely manner or the program becomes less valuable. As a platform, we have to deliver
      that value even when students are not in optimal brain space.</p>


    <p class="pb-4">Some other challenges we identified were:
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
      <li>Students who were not well-versed in tech might not <em>want</em> to use slack.</li>
      <li>Frankly, new people are scary.</li>
      <li>Asking questions can be scary.</li>
      <li>What if no one is available?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="pb-6">These were all real concerns we kept in mind during these processes. It became a sort of tenet of
      this work to "Minimize anxiety," as best we could.

        <h3 class="text-2xl mb-2 font-bold">Research & Planning</h3>
        <p class="pb-6">Everything, for me, starts with people. Our team found common qualitative and quantitative
          actions in what we referred to as <em>Bright Spot Students</em>. On their path to success, these students had
          engaged with our Slack groups early and often. Engaging in conversation, creating camaraderie, and asking
          questions related to coursework. We found that students who were most engaged with the community as a support
          system tended to be more successful.</p>


        <p class="pb-6 col-span-2">Digging into some of the qualitative data that teachers had been collecting was
          helpful. Correlating it with quantitative data inside our products told the full story. We found that many of
          our students who were not successful were lacking a few of the key Bright Spot Student traits. These
          unsuccessful students were doing the work. Often the main differentiator was that they were not engaged in the
          community.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl mb-2 font-bold">The Work</h3>
      <p class="pb-6">I started by assessing our student's in-app lifecycle. Bright spot student traits became a sort of
        north star for us. Our TD students lived in three main areas of the product. The Dashboard, the
        learning/assessment views, and Workspaces. Workspaces held a lot of legacy code and were not in the scope of the
        current project. Each of these spaces has a specific set of actions that it prioritizes.

  <section class="max-w-4xl">
    <p class="pb-6">The Dashboard provides guidance on the student's progress, success, and next steps. The student
      lifecycle allowed us to optimize for certain actions inside a goven space and gave us more information to go on
      when prioritizing tasks for this project. The missing piece was finding the help the student needed when she
      needed it. We started this project by working through a lot of rough ideas. These earlier ideas focused on things
      like early Slack adoption and even course retargeting.</p>

  <section class="max-w-4xl">
    <p class="pb-6">It was at this point that we circled back to the idea around the office hours for students. Our
      Bright Spot Students were often active participants in this program. Taking it upon themselves to field the
      emailed list of weekly dates and times and attending the Slack/Zoom meetings.
    <p class="pb-6">

    <p class="pb-6">This was interesting for 2 reasons:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal mb-4 pl-8">
      <li class="pb-2"> If we could automate or semi-automate this process for Success Reps it would lift some burden
        off them and free them up to engage with students more.</li>
      <li> If we could get students involved with office hours sooner in their journey, we might see a drop in churn
        after the trial.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="pb-6">Identifying the challenges of the students and our success reps early on were integral to this
      project. They were reporting 2 sides of the same problem! We started sorting out how we might better serve both
      students and Success reps.</p>

  <section class="max-w-4xl mb-4">
    <p class="mb-2">When we started working on this project a few things became clear about the dashboard:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc mb-4 pl-8">
      <li>The Mentorship program called out in the dashboard was no longer happening. (Experience Debt)</li>
      <li>The Slack call to action (CTA) was very thin.</li>
      <li>There was no internal messaging about events or support.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4">We removed the mentoring section and cleaned up the Slack CTA a bit as a first iteration. That was a
      big win - removing experience debt and giving students a clear call to action was helpful. We knew there was more
      we could do. Our next iteration was focused on bringing those office hours into the app for visibility and
      clarity. We worked with our Success team to get office hours schedules ahead of time and in addition to their
      regular email we hardcoded the office hours schedule into the app. This was a trade-off we made to lessen the
      impact on success reps while we tested this feature over the next several weeks.</p>

    <p class="pb-6">We started testing Mockups and prototypes straight away. Teachers were using the above version of
      the dashboard in upcoming exit interviews. Through those exit interviews, we found that 4 of 5 students were
      either unaware or routinely forgot about office hours. That felt like a big win. There was still work to do to
      improve this feature before we shipped it though.</p>

    <p class="pb-6">Updating the layout of the office hours schedule to feel more like an event was the first order of
      business. A common layout with the necessary information so it stands out as easy to read and understand. The next
      piece was creating a more helpful call to action for Slack. We felt like outlining the real-world benefits of
      using slack for the TD program was crucial.</p>

      Building a simple backend for the office hours UI was going to streamline the processes of the Student Success
      team. Students would be able to see when office hours, and eventually, other events were taking place. There was a
      lot to be excited about here. One piece of feedback kept nagging at me though.</p>

    <p class="pb-6">It was impersonal. Beyond initial barriers, there was still a lack of familiarity and human
      interaction. It's hard to feel a human connection in a product. One of the ways that we can do that though, is
      with faces. Avatars create a mixed-reality world where you can connect with someone with a sense of familiarity.
      We wanted to find ways to use this to our advantage in the dashboard. This went through several iterations.</p>

      points of contact, it was a no-brainer to use those people as a student-facing lifeline in the dashboard. Most
      TD's had one lead success rep. We added that person to the dashboard in a new section called, "Your Techdegree
      Support Center."</p>

    <p class="pb-6">After doing the front-end work for this project I had the opportunity to again reach out to some
      students for feedback. In those conversations, there were 2 of 5 students that said they were likely to return to
      a TD program. According to a source, after I had left Treehouse, the office hours attendance had gone up ~25%
      since launch. Before joining Treehouse I was a student and a big fan of the organization in general. I'm very
      proud of the work I got to do in the short time I was there.</p>
