        <h2 class="font-normal">The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Despite robust content and structured learning paths, student engagement with Techdegree's live support systems (like office hours) was abysmally low—often under 20%. Through interviews and data analysis, we uncovered the real problem:

          Students weren't failing for lack of effort. <strong>They were failing alone.</strong>

        <h2 class="font-normal">Key Insight</h2>
        <p>
          We studied a cohort of "Bright Spot Students"—those who succeeded despite the same constraints. The pattern was clear:

            </ul>

          </div>
        </div>

          Our design hypothesis became clear:

        <div>
          <p class="text-2xl font-bold md:font-medium italic text-center !leading-normal">
            Increasing visibility and approachability of live community tools (especially office hours) would improve conversion, retention, and student outcomes.

        <h2 class="font-normal">Design Approach</h2>
        <p>
          As the sole designer on this project, I owned the end-to-end experience — from student research to stakeholder alignment to final handoff. I facilitated cross-functional reviews, ran iterative prototyping sessions, and led the design critique that landed on the final Slack CTA and dashboard layout.

          <p> Slack isn’t obvious or intuitive to everyone. And in educational contexts, asking for help can feel risky — especially for new or underrepresented students.</p>
          
          <p>But among our Bright Spot Students, Slack wasn’t just a channel — it was <strong>the backbone of their support network</strong>. So we focused not on replacing it, but on making its benefits feel more visible, human, and immediate.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl">Supporting At-Risk Students through Behavioral Triggers</h3>
          <p>
            We noticed that students who dropped off early in the program often cited confusion or second thoughts — not dissatisfaction. We explored gentle retargeting strategies using behavioral triggers (such as early inactivity) to offer support, course changes, or personal outreach without shame or pressure.

        <h2 class="font-normal">Tradeoffs & Decisions</h2>
        <p>
          While redesigning support visibility across the Techdegree experience, we made several key decisions to balance speed, feasibility, and student impact:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Scoped MVP around Dashboard only</strong> — Legacy code in Workspaces would have created delivery risk. We focused instead on modern, high-traffic surfaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hardcoded schedules to validate need</strong> — Instead of building dynamic scheduling infra up front, we hardcoded office hours based on known availability. This let us launch faster and test demand with less cost.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prioritized familiarity over novelty</strong> — We avoided creating a new live chat system and leaned into Slack because it was already in use by successful students. Our job wasn’t to invent — it was to reduce friction.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote class="italic text-xl mt-6 pl-0">
          <p>The new dashboard made it easier to connect with students who actually needed help — we stopped guessing who was struggling.</p>
