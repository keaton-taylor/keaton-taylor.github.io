  <h3>The Challenges</h3>
  <p>Making fundraising and nonprofit volunteering more fun and social is hard. Fundraising is often a solitary experience. You donate and you go about your business. At RaiseMore we wanted to make fundraising a team sport. How can we offer a competitive platform? How can we give leaders the power to coach based on performance & quantifiable metrics? We aimed to answer these questions and unfortunately the answer was sometimes, “We can’t.”</p>

  <p>Our system built semi-custom native apps with the Ionic framework. Using a front end "store" workflow, users would choose colors, upload logos and adjust a template to their specs. Once finished, the mobile app compiled and was sent to the App Store. Users were then given access to a dashboard with tools to maintain their subscription and events.</p>

  <p>I came to RaiseMore hoping to make a difference. I cut my teeth working for non-profit's like Art Feeds and the Hippo Valley Christian Mission. The idea that I could help similar nonprofits be successful was exciting.  I worked with the design team, engineers and our product manager to grok challenging day-to-day problems. In addition to being an IC and contributing day-to-day I also brought advocacy for a more user-centered process. At the time, my focus was moving from visual design to being more experience focused. That renewed focus was obvious in my work and interactions with coworkers. I set out to help other team members consider things like color accessibility and common interaction patterns.</p>

  <h3>The RaiseMore Beta</h3>
  <p>In September of 2015, We ran a two day feedback summit in Oklahoma City with the entire RaiseMore team. We went through 4 feedback sessions. The rounds of one-on-one interaction with real people was incredibly helpful. The Group discussions On Day 3 discussing the product roadmap was very insightful. The weekend would inform a lot of the next several months of product features and iteration.</p>

<section class="container__small">
  <p>We brought in both tech and fundraising people included large organizations like M.D. Anderson as well as smaller orgs like Carry the Load. We went through rounds of feedback on both the actual products and also our roadmap going forward. The insights from that session were insanely helpful and surprising. Among our team, there was a feeling that we really had our finger on the pulse of the industry and in the end, that feeling was a bit of a liability. While we did have a good handle on software design - we did not, in fact - have a good handle on the needs of our fundraising users.</p>

  <p>I wanted to create this post to document some of the things we looked at in case those things are at all helpful for others. Some of it's dated but it might have some helpful things to at least <em>think</em> about when you begin a software project. Especially one for users that you're new to working with.</p>

  <p>Here are a Few Takeaways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li> Up to 80% of our users would be using Windows computers. Up to 30% of those might use touchscreen technology in some capacity.</li>
    <li> Our collective use of Apple hardware caused us to miss some glaring usability issues. We missed hover states, color inconsistencies and responsive issues on smaller screens. We missed these things because we were seeing the product through our tech focused lens.</li>
    <li> Visual design inside the dashboard caused a lot of confusion. Defaulting to ghost buttons and a flat UI pattern was often and easily missed by our testers.</li>
    <li> Our internal bias toward aesthetics vs. experience was exposed. This surfaced some internal frustration on our team between UX and Visual design imperatives. The dialogue we had here was tense but positive. If people can't accomplish the product tasks, we will have a hard time making them customers.</li>
    <li> The things we thought were going to be super important were a lot less important. One of our assumptions was that the person using the app would start at the feed page. This would allow people to see the status and relevant data points of all their teammates. During testing, our groups let us know they would opt for a view based on the health of their event(s) instead.</li>
    <li> An interesting pattern emerged here. The money raised is important but not on such a granular level. The overall event health was a more desirable metric. From there our partners could dig deeper and address individual coaching needs. There was a very "leader-leader" structure to the way our partners managed events.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In addition to the findings above and our notebooks full of information after the beta, we had a crew on hand to film the days. Enjoy.</p>

  <h3>Onboarding</h3>
  <p>On-boarding is hard. Reworking the general login process was an imperative. One of the glaring issues was the technical debt left over from our Bootstrap MVP. During this Sprint we used more time than we expected walking through the signup process. One of the challenges we spent the most time on was the amount of data we needed to collect. Where is the line between too much and not enough? We weren't sure. In hindsight what we were asking for became a barrier to entry.</p>

  <p>Our goals for the update were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make signup as easy as possible.
    <li>Capture the smallest possible amount of information:
      <ul>
        <li>Organization - We need this to organize Teams inside the mobile app based on the Administrator's and Team Leader's org affiliation.
        <li>Name
        <li>Email
        <li>Password
      </ul>
    <li>Immediately push people into an action after signup.
  </ul>

  <p>In the course of discussing the new on-boarding flow and walking through it with our stakeholders and potential users we exposed a glaring flaw. There were no less than 4 places for a person to sign up and define credentials. In general this doesn't have to be a problem but it becomes one if the experience is not consistent and planned for.</p>

  <h3>Social Sharing</h3>
  <p>One of the problems we wanted to tackle was reworking our social sharing workflow. Designing around the complications in sharing for native iOS apps (at the time) was an interesting problem. We ran a couple of modified design sprints around mobile sharing. Before we got into the sprint we set out some loose req's to make sure we were working toward a unified end.</p>

  <p>We set out one major people need and a couple of gotchas to plan for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>As a person using this software I need to be able to share both to social media and in their timeline inside the App.</li>
    <li>We needed to design around a framework of extensibility. It's the only way to ensure the ability to add social media platforms when necessary.</li>
    <li>We have to live with the fact that we're not Instagram. We're going to have to send separate messages from separate fields.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The person would need to select their social media platforms, write a main post and agree every time the post went to a new social outlet. The final screen is the success screen, the screen below is the “Would you like to send another update?” dialogue. This was a really complex workflow, but was the reality of sharing as we understood it at the time. From there we thought a lot about the interaction. The next social media post sliding up from the bottom for example. we started fleshing this out a little more to hand off to engineering for some prototyping.</p>

<h3>In-App Coaching</h3>
  <p>During the course of my time at RaiseMore there was one feature I coveted more than any other. Based on feedback during the beta, it was the white whale for events-based fundraising. I loved the possibilities around in-app coaching and messaging. I loved the idea of our team leaders being able to insert content into someone's feed to encourage them or coach them. Our original idea was just that this would come in the form of a push notification. Push notifications turned out to be a technical limitation. As an alternative we looked into adding both automated messages and what it might look like to allow an admin to send messages from the admin dashboard.

  <p>Our first step was to define some types of messages that might be sent. Warning Alerts, Coaching, Reminders, Data Points. The possibilities of message types are nearly endless. We went through a few different types of message and thought about how it might look and feel. starting with the icons it might use.</p>

  <p>The implementation was more challenging than we were ready to take on at such an early stage. We opted to work with the icons and an integrated color-field that might be slightly different depending on the colors chosen in the app building process.</p>
