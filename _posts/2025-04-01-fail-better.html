title: "Some Thoughts on Failing Better."
permalink: /fail-better.html

I’ve failed quietly. I’ve failed loudly. The trick, I think, is turning the mess into momentum.

I used to think failure was the end of a story. These days, I think it’s a chapter break—a spot where you take a beat, get honest, and decide what to carry forward and what to leave behind.

A few years ago, I launched a small business plan for Soundstripe aimed at SMBs. We did our research, picked our price point, built the plan… and then watched as absolutely no one bought it. The worst part? It cannibalized other, better-performing subscriptions. I could’ve thrown my hands up. Instead, I got curious.

Why didn’t it work? What did we assume that turned out false? What would we test differently next time?

We went back to the drawing board with a leaner pricing test, sharper eligibility criteria, and new ways of measuring success. The rebound wasn’t flashy, but it was real. That’s how you fail better: not by never falling, but by learning to rise without dragging old baggage with you.

This idea—owning your story and rewriting it with more clarity—is something I’ve had to keep relearning as a designer, too.

I once spent months crafting a high-conviction vision for a product experience only to have it get diluted during handoff. The design made it into prod, but not in a way I was proud of. The hard lesson? Vision doesn’t count if you can’t sell it, defend it, and build the coalition around it. I failed to rally the team—but that failure taught me how to build trust earlier, how to plant flags instead of digging trenches, and how to communicate risk without sounding like a saboteur.

That one came with bruises. But I wouldn’t trade it. It made me more useful the next time a cross-functional moment needed a steady hand.

I’m still not great at vulnerability. (If you’re curious: I scored a 3.8/10 on that in a leadership self-assessment. Yikes.) But I’m working on it—because being brave isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about being able to get back up, own your part, and try again, this time a little wiser.

So if something flopped recently, here’s your permission slip to dust off, learn what you can, and keep moving. Failing better is still failing. But it’s also where real momentum begins.
