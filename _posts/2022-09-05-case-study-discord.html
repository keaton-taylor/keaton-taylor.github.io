  <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl">Platform Changes</h2>
  <p class="py-2">As part of the newly formed Activities Platform team, we made the decision to integrate Activities into Discord's Voice feature. A mixture of technical and operational constraints made the decision pretty easy, but the challenges were only starting.</p>

  <p class="py-2">Since Activities are only available during Voice Calls, we needed to find ways to make them accessible both inside and outside of these calls. We added new viewing options, such as a video grid view and a focused view that highlights ongoing Activities. We also introduced an activity shelf launcher UI, which makes it easy to access Activities from different parts of the app.</p>

  <p class="py-2">To ensure that Activities were easily found by users, we integrated them into different areas of the app, including the channel list sidebar, RTC panel, rich presence on profiles, and the Active Now panels.</p>

  <p class="py-2">Designing a way to display Activities in different areas of the app while maintaining a clean, cohesive look was a challenge we faced. After several iterations, we came up with the "Activity shelf," which displays the necessary metadata and artwork in an optimal way.</p>

  <p class="py-2">In summary, our team made significant changes to the Discord platform by integrating Activities into the Voice feature, implementing new ways to view and access them, and integrating them into different parts of the app while maintaining a consistent, polished design.</p>
