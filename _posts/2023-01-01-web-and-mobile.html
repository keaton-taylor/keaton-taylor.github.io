      Website for <a href="http://batteryoutfitters.com/">Battery Outfitters.</a> Working with my friends at <a
        href="buildmidwestern.com">Midwestern Interactive</a>, I wireframed and designed the front end experiences for
      the entire website. Working with Midwestern and a local advertising agency, we worked with the client to make
      sure the flow was tidy, intuitive and informational.<br><small>Role: Design</small>

      Concept for a Logistics and Trucking App to Keep Drivers and Load Booking Crew Informed. This concept was an
      idea gathering session with a friend who actually works on a similar piece of software. We looked at existing
      user needs and made some educated guesses about updates that could be helpful.<br><small>Role: Design</small>

      <a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/color_search#/">Color Search with Sherwin-Williams and McKinney</a> My
      first project at AT Media was a complete overhaul of our Sherwin-Williams sponsored Color Search tool, which was
      a collaboration with <a href="https://mckinney.com/">McKinney</a>. I came into the process as wireframes were
      being completed and was able to jump in and contribute to the team in the first 2 weeks after I started. Our
      work did not go unnoticed - along with our partners at McKinney and our direct sales and creative services
      teams, our work on Color Search won an IAB Mixx award in 2016.<br><small>Role: Design, HTML(erb), CSS</small>

      <b>Helping Build an A/B Testing Framework and Using It.</b> Because of my love for data-informed design I was
      tapped to work with our Lead Front End Engineer to build a new system into our - largely monolithic - codebase.
      Using a fancy Varnish setup, courtesy of our Back End team, we created an internal methodology to use feature
      flippers and traffic splitting via our CDN. We were able to test this out of the box on social sharing designs
      for images. Our tests Eventually produced a 20% increase m/m in social sharing to Pinterest.<br><small>Role:

      <b>Community Focused initiatives.</b> My all-time favorite projects for AT Media have been the online community
      driven initiatives. Launching our new Save feature, refreshing our profile pages and ongoing projects to
      integrate more connective community features have been a joy to work on. We have a dedicated user0base that
      loves to connect through comments and social media. It's been a real treat developing features to satisfy some
      long-standing requests and work with users to develop a roadmap of new and upcoming features.<br><small>Role:
