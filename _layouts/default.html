        <p class="pb-6 text-md leading-relaxed">Iâ€™m designing for growth at <a class="font-medium pinkjoy" href="www.soundstripe.com">Soundstripe</a>. Before that, I worked on the Activity and Platform teams at <a class="font-medium discord" href="www.discordapp.com">Discord</a> and even further back I worked at places like <a class="font-medium envoy" href="www.envoy.com">Envoy</a> and <a class="font-medium treehouse" href="www.teamtreehouse.com.com">Treehouse</a>. I'm really good at cutting through the noise that makes it hard for small teams to move with conviction and velocity. I really enjoy simplifying systems, developing common sense processes, and producing positive outcomes for design, product, and engineering teams.</p>
